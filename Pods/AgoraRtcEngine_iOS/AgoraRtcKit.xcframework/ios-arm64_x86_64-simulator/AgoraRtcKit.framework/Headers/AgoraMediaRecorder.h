 * After successfully calling \ref AgoraRtcEngineKit.createMediaRecorder: createMediaRecorder to get the media recorder object

 *
 * This method can record the following content:
 * - The audio captured by the local microphone and encoded in AAC format.
 * - The video captured by the local camera and encoded by the SDK.
 * 
 * This method can record the following content:
 * - The audio received from remote users and encoded in AAC format.
 * - The video received from remote users.
 *
 *
 * The SDK can generate a recording file only when it detects the recordable audio and video streams; when there are
 * no audio and video streams to be recorded or the audio and video streams are interrupted for more than five
 * seconds, the SDK stops recording and triggers the
 * \ref AgoraMediaRecorderDelegate.stateDidChanged "stateDidChanged" (AgoraMediaRecorderState, AgoraMediaRecorderReasonCode)
 * callback.

 * @note Call this method after joining the channel.

 *      - The recording is ongoing.
 *      - The recording stops because an error occurs.
